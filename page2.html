							<p>The idea behind HTML was a modest one. When <strong>Tim Berners-Lee</strong> was putting together his first elementary browsing and authoring system for the Web, he created a quick little hypertext language that would serve his purposes. He imagined dozens, or even hundreds, of hypertext formats in the future, and smart clients that could easily negotiate and translate documents from servers across the Net. It would be a system similar to Claris XTND on the Macintosh, but would work on any platform and browser. <br />
							The problem, however, turned out to be in the simplicity of Berners-Lee's language. Since it was text-based, you could use any editor or word processor to create or convert documents for the Web. And there was just a handful of tags – anyone could master HTML in an afternoon. The Web flourished. Everyone started publishing. The rest is history. <br />
							But as more and more content moved to the Web, those creating browsers realized the simple markup language needed much improvement. How should the innovation take place? Tim Berners-Lee certainly wasn't going to be the sole developer of HTML – he never intended to be. So the developers, in the long-held tradition of the Internet, implemented new features in their browsers and then shipped them. If the Web community liked them, they stayed. If not, they were removed. </p>

									<dd>At the addition of images to the Web. Early browsers were simply text-based, and there was an immediate desire to display figures and icons inline on a page. In <strong>1993</strong>, a debate was exploding on the fledgling HTML mailing list, and finally a college student named Marc Andreessen added &lt;img&gt; to his Mosaic browser. People objected, saying it was too limited. They wanted &lt;include&gt; or &lt;embed&gt;, which would allow you to add any sort of media to a Web page with the much-touted content negotiation used on the client. That was too big a project, according to Marc, and he need to ship ASAP. Mosaic went with &lt;img&gt;, and it would be years before including media in a page using &lt;embed&gt;, or &lt;applet&gt;, or &lt;object&gt; would come to the surface again. <br />
							Tim Berners-Lee, a scientist and academic, was the primary author of HTML, with the assistance of his colleagues at CERN, an international scientific organization based in Geneva. Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web in 1989 at CERN. He was named one of Time magazine's 100 most important people of the 20th century for this accomplishment.

						<blockquote cite="https://www.techopedia.com/definition/7619/html-tag"> <cite> HTML tags have always been important in the history of Web design. During the early days of the World Wide Web, they were responsible for a majority of Web code. That may not be the case anymore, but HTML tags are still at the center of how Web pages are formatted. Other kinds of languages have been built around the backbone of HTML, such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), which makes it easier to create consistent and overarching styles and color schemes. </cite>
